# Private Jarvis Assistant – Brand-Driven Hero Section

Welcome to the brand-driven hero section project for **Private Jarvis Assistant**, a fully offline, privacy-focused virtual assistant built to run on powerful personal hardware.

## Project Overview
This website hero section showcases the core value proposition and identity of a local AI assistant that:

- Operates without the cloud (complete privacy)  
- Leverages open-source LLMs, Whisper STT, and local TTS  
- Runs efficiently on machines like an RTX 3070-powered gaming PC  

## Brand Strategy
- **Archetype**: Magician – empowers users with transformation and control  
- **Target Audience**: Tech-savvy privacy advocates and DIYers  
- **Persuasion Principles**:  
  - **Authority**: Highlights specs, local performance  
  - **Scarcity**: Emphasizes exclusive, local-only experience  
  - **Liking**: Aligns with user values around privacy and open-source  

## Key Message
**Headline**: Your Private Jarvis. No Cloud. No Limits.  
**Subtext**: Experience a voice-controlled AI assistant that runs entirely on your PC—faster, safer, and smarter.
